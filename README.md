# Prior-Approvals

This is an ongoing project conducted to understand the impact of increased Permitted Development Rights (PDRs) using planning data on prior approvals from the Greater London Authority.

The analysis will be completed in August 2022 which reflects one full year since the changes took place. 

Initial exploratory data analysis is reflective of data received mid-December 2021.
